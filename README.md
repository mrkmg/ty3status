ty3status
=========

ty3status is a replacement for i3status, py3status, or i3blocks. ty3status is written in typescript with first class
support for javascript blocks, but allows for blocks to be written in any language. 

ty3status was written to facilitate a performant way to use javascript to write blocks for your i3bar. It has since
expanded to include features from many other status line programs.

- "Module" blocks - blocks written in javascript.
- "Legacy" blocks - reuse already written blocks from other status line programs like i3status or i3blocks.
- "Persistent" blocks - long running programs which occasionally output information.
- Color support
- i3-gaps background and border support
- UTF-8 compatible
- Pango compatible


## Quick Getting Started

Install ty3status.

    git clone https://github.com/mrkmg/ty3status.git /tmp/ty3status && \
    cd /tmp/ty3status && \
    git checkout $(git describe --long --tags) && \
    (yarn || npm install) && \
    npm run build && \
    sudo npm run system-install

Change your status line program in your i3 config to ty3status.

    ...
    status_command ty3status --config /path/to/config
    ...    

Create a ty3status config file for your user account.

    cp /etc/ty3status.yaml ~/.config/ty3status.yaml
    
Modify the file as needed, then restart i3.
